        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I started programming for fun, but Development seemed very interesting as you can see the changes live as
          soon as you made them. As we are advancing more and more in technology. From the increasing security headache
          of the internet of things to machine learning everywhere, the future of programming keeps getting harder to
          predict.
          I started with JavaScript, and loved it so much that i completed all the relative aspects of full-stack based
          on Js.
          Such as Express, React and Node. </p>

        <h3>MongoDB</h3>
        <p>If you take people who've never used a database before and you teach them MongoDB and then teach them a
          relational database, MongoDB is so much easier and more intuitive to them. I had studied the SQL and MySQL in
          college. But MongoDB made me free from any kind of boundation SQL had.
          It's easy to think of documents in collections like rows in a relational database table, except that these
          documents can have any arbitrary amount of properties (like columns for rows) and they can be different for
          each document and include lots of nesting like arrays of more properties. This is very powerful way to store
          complex data and matches up well to the object-oriented nature of most programming languages.</p>

      <h3>Node Js</h3>
      <p> Well! i started with PHP as a server side scripting language. But later on i switched to Node. One of the
        biggest reasons why i chose NodeJs is because it uses JavaScript as its main language to
        build web applications. ... Since JavaScript is a language that most developers know or have used at some point
        of time, the transition from another web technology to Node. js is a breeze. Typically, Node.js uses a basic
        event-driven architecture. This means everything executed on it, including every single operation and call, is a
        series of asynchronous callback. This enables us to run our web applications on a single thread as unlike other
        web technologies
        where a new thread is spawned for every client request.</p>
